## Blue-Green Deployment
- zero downtime when upgrading can be accomplished with blue-green deployments

*serializing objects*
if using serializing objects, dont make destructive changes
e.g. dont remove fields, do have a seialVersionUID

## 12 Factor: Admin Processes
- run admin/mgmt tasks as one-ff processes
e.g. migrating data

*database*
- do make changes idempotent
e.g. copy data to a new field (dont delete data)
- no destruction database changes allowed
e.g. dont drop a column
- do have backwards compatible changes
e.g. nullable fields

`cf routes`

*map routes to new version*
`cf map-route <app-v2> <domain> -n <subdomain/host>`

*slowly move to new version via scaling*
`cf scale <app-v1> -i 1`
`cf scale <app-v2> -i 2`

`cf unmap-route <app-v1> <domain> -n <subdomain/host>`

`cf apps`

## unmap temp url for v2
`cf unmap-route <app-v2> <domain> <host>`

## what's the purpose of blue-green deployment?
> to achieve no downtime when managing multiple version of your application and managing deploying those

## How's the distribution of traffic handle when running multiple version of an application?
> when multiple version is bound to the same route, it's base on the % of app instance that the version is running. traffice will be distributed accordingly. 

## t/f. when releasing a new vesion of an applicatin, adding a new non-nullable field to a database table is an acceptable blue/green stragegy? 
> false. old version will run into problem.

## design implication of running two version of the same time have on your application?
> need to be backward compatible and non destructive.
