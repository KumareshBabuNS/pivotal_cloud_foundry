## Route Service
Provide transformation or processing to requests before/after they reach an application.

*route services - examples*
- authentication
- rate limiting
- logging
- caching

*route service request flow*
client -> load balancer -> router -> route service -> load balancer -> app

## route service - headers
- *x-cf-forwarded-url*
	- contains the url of the application route
	- do the logic (logging, rate limiting, etc) and forward request to value specified back to load balancer
	- this header is strip out prior to going to downstream app
- *x-cf-proxy-signature* && *x-cf-proxy-metadata* 
	- used by the router to validate the request and pass through to the appication
	- make sure that we dont get stuck in an infinite loop


`cf bind-route-service <domain> route-service --hostname <hostname>`
