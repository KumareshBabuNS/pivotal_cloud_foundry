## Droplet (tarball)
- your application and all the runtime support it need to run
	- buildpack
	- application
		- app server
		- libraries
		- runtime

*Buildpack API*
- bin/detect
	- determines whether the buildpack can stage the application
- bin/compile
	- builds the droplet
- bin/release
	- provides information on how to run the application

*bin/detect*
- detection criteria
	- ruby: gemfile exists
	- node: package.json exists
	- python: setup.py exists
- cf push
	- cell iterates over all admin and system buldpacks calling:
		bin/detect scripts until one returns exit code 0
- cf push -b <url|name> 
	- bin/detect is not called

*bin/compile*
- provide any of the following if needed:
	- runtime: java vm, ruby interperter, javascript interpreter
	- app server: tomcat, nginx, webrick
	- support libraries: ruby gems, npm packages, AP???

*bin/release*
- output a yaml document in the following form:
	config_vars:
		name: value
	default_process_types:
		web: <start command>
- only the web: value is used to get the start command for the app

*what does offline buildpack mean?*
- only certain number of dependencies that it support, will not be able to provision every version of java out there.

`cf push <app> -p ./<app_path>.jar -b <url>`
`cf push <app> -p ./<app_path>.jar -b https://github.com/cloudfroundry/java-buildpack.git`


`cf set-env <app> JBP_CONFIG_OPEN_JDK_JRE "{jre: {version: 1.8.0_46}}"`
