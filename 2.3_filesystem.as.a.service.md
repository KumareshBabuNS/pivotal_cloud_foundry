## File System as a Service
- Backing Service & Processes (12 Factor App)


*container file system is temporary*
- applications taht rely on file system would not be able to be ported to PCF.

*file system as a service*
- independent of the container
- out-lives the container
- nfs mounted storage

*marketplace service: nfs*
- adminstrator must enable volume servcies

*nfs service*
- usage pattern is the same as for other services
`create: use -c opotion to specify volume`

`cf create-service nfs Existing nfs_service_instance -c '{"share": "10.10.10.10/export/myshare"}'`

`bind: user -c option to specify GID and UID`

`cf bind-service my-app nfs_service_instance -c '{"uid": "1000", "gid":"1000", "mount":"/var/volumne1"}'`

`cf restage my-app`

*once the service has been created and bind, the application can lookup connection infromation from VCAP_SERVICES environment variables*
