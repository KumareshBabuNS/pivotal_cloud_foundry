are virtual firewalls that control egress/outbound traffic for applications

*Staging Security Groups*
- whitelist what the app should have access to when staging

*running security groups*
- whitelist what all apps should have access to when running
- apply to all org/space

*space security groups*
- whitelist what the app should have access to when running
- union with running security group
