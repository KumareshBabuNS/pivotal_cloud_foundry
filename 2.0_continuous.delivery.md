## Continuos Delivery
Build software so that it can be released to production at anytime.

Continuos delivery != continuous deployment

*who decides when to go to prod?*
The business (technical teams should be ready).

*application delivery with continuous delivery*
- smaller deployments reduce risk and increase feedback

*continuos delivery strategies*
- do implement continuos integration
- do not create environment specific packages
- do externalize environment specific configuration
- dont assume existing processes are right
- do not use a different process for different environments
- do recreate app environments frequently
- do ensure that database changes are automated.
- do deploy more frequently
- do automate all testing where test failures would prevent a production release from occurring
- do try to use tools that support the process

*blue-green deployments can be used with a continuos delivery pipeline*
