## Tasks
unlike a long-running process (lrp), a task runs once and then terminates

eg: 
- application staging
- database migration
- sending an email
- running a batch job
- processing images
- uploading data

*running a task*
- tasks that run in pcf are assocated with an app
`cf run-task <app-name> <command>`

`cf run-task my-app "bin/rails db:migrate" --name my-task`

`cf logs my-app --recent`

`cf task` monitor status
`cf terminate-task` cancel a task (status will show as FAILED)

*each task run in it own container*
*task execution history is retain for a period of one month*
