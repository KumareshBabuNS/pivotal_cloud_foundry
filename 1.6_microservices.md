## Microservices

## monolith
- a three tiered monolith bundle as an artifact
	- data access
	- service
	- views

*monolith design patterns*
- traditional monolithic design patterns are not appropriate for the cloud
	- *anti cloud patterns*
		-	write to filesystem and counting on the disk to always be there
		- passing session state among application servers instead of a persistence storage db
	- *change cycle*
		- monoliths couple change cycles together
			- this service has bug fixes and enhancements completed but must wait for changes in the rest of the app.
	- *scaling*
		- monoliths services can't be scaled independently.
		- inefficient scaling
	- *coordination*
		- too many developers in one code base. 
		- difficult to coordinate
	- *knowledge*
		- developers struggle to understand a large codebase
	- *commitment*
		- long term commitment to the tech stack

## microservices
*the importance of APIs*
> All teams will henceforth expose their data and functionality through service interfaces. --Jeff Bezos (2002)

*microservices defined*
> Microservices are a loosely coupled service-oriented architecture (SOA) with bounded contexts. -- Adrian Cockcroft

*unix pipes and filters*
a microservice has a single responsibility.

`cut -d" " -f1 < access.log | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | less` 

*bounded context*
microservices use a bounded context
	- having a wholelistic enterprise data model of one size fit all is impossible and not cost effective.
		- having a unified data model under one specific context is possible
			- product catalog: movie
			- inventory: movie
				- each bounded context should be able to define what "movie" mean, and manage its microservices without conflict

*organize around business capabilities*
- cross-functional teams
	- miroservice architectures

## microservice architecture
*polyglot persistence*
	- freedom to pick the persistence solution
*polyglot apps*
	- choice of language when developing apps
*API Gateway*
	- device specific gateways
*cloud protocols*
	- use cloud friendly protocols

	*microservice change cycle*
		- change cycles are decoupled. enabling frequent deploys.
	*scale*
		- allow for efficient scaling
	*knowledge*
		- developers learn a smaller codebse faster*
	*coordination*
		- fewer developers in each code base.


## Cons
*significatn operations overhead*
- microservices have significant operations overhead
	- *consider* 
		buildpacks
		health mgmt
		services
		monitoring
		scaling 
		dynamic routing

*substantial devops skills required*
- substantial devops skills are required to run microservices.
	- *consider*
		health mgmt
		buildpacks
		space parity & ummutable infrastructure
		polygot persisteence via servcie brokers


** no central orchestrator b/t all different services when using microservice.
** microservices know how to discover one another and interact without a central coordinator
