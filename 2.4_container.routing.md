## Container to Container Routing
*without Container-to-container routing*
- apps in pcf (eg. microservices) may need to communicate
	- url's are public
	- all requests pass through GoRouter

*with Container-to-Container (C-C) routing*
- once permitted, apps can communicate directly
- eliminate network cost
- applications url's no longer public
- fewer netowrk hops -> better performance

*caveat*
- client-side load balancing is required
	- java applications can use netflix ribbon
	- node.js applications can use resilient

*enabling container to container routing*
- must be enabled by your pcf administrator
- install network-policy-plugin for CF CLI
`cf install-plugin ./network-policy-plugin`
`cf allow-access frontend backend -protocol tcp port 8080`
