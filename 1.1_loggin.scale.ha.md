## Logging, Scale, and HA
*distributed system*
- distributed systems are hard to build, test, manage, and scale

*ephemeral infrastructure*
- virtual machines and containers are temporary.

*immutable infrastructure*
- updates to systems and applications are not done in-place but rather new, updated instances are created instead

## 12 Factor Apps (4 main point)
*processes*
- execute the app as one or more stateless processes

*concurrency*
- scale out via th eprocess model

*disposability*
- maximize robutness with fast starup and graceful shutdown

*logs*
- treat logs as event streams

## Elastic Runtime Architecture
*elastic runtime subsystems*
- diego
- loggregator
- cloud controller api
- routing
*key sequence flows through the ER*

_Diego_
- schedules tasks and long-running processes (LRPs).
- Diego: Task
	- is guaranteed to run at most once
	- e.g. stage an application
- Diego: LRP
	- is a long-running process, typically represented as a web app
	- LRPs can have multiple instances
- Diego: Containter
	- an application instance is run within an immutable container
- Diego: Cell
	- containers are run within a cell
- Diego: Garden
	- containers are managed by Garden
	- Garden is an interface
	- Garden-Linux is a backed implementation
- Diego: Rep
	- represents the cell in the BBS/auctions
- Diego: Auction
	- an auction is held to bid on executing a task or an LRP
- Diego: Executor
	- manages container allocations on the cell
	-also streams stdout and stderr to metron
- Diego: Metron
	- forwards logs to the loggregator subsystem
- Diego: BBS
	- BBS (bulletin board system) is the api to access the diego database for tasks and LRPS
	- Data is persisted to etcd
- Diego: Brain
	- the brain composed of two components: auctioneer, converger
	- auctioneer: hold auctions for tasks and LRPs
	- converger: reconciles desired LRPs vs actual LRPs through auctions

_Loggregator_
- Loggregator: Metron
	- forwards logas to the loggregator subsystem
- Loggregator: doppler
	- gathers logs from metron
	- app syslog drains: splunk, papertrail
- Loggregator: traffic controller
	- handles client requests for logs
	- `cf logs <app>`
	- also exposes a websocket endpoint called the firehose 
- Loggregator: firehose
	- a websocket endpoint that exposes app logs, container metrics and ER component metrics
	- does not include ER component logs
- Loggregator: nozzles
	- consume the firehose output

_Cloud Controller_
- CCAPI: Cloud Controller
	- the cloud controller exposes an api for using and managign the elastic runtime
- CCAPI: cloud controller database
	- the cloud controller persists org/space/app data in the cloud controller database
- CCAPI: blob store
	- the cloud controller persists app packages and droplets to the blob store
- CCAPI: CC-Bridge
	- translate app specific messages into the generic language of tasks and LRPs

_Routing_
- Router
	- routes traffic to appropriate component

## Stage and Run Request Flow
- cloud controller passes requests to run and stage applications to the CC-Bridge
- CC-Bridge pass to BBS
- BBS submits tasks and LRPs to the Auctioneer (Brain)
- Auctioneer assigns the task or LRP to a cell. The executor creates a Garden container in the cell. The task or LRP runs in the conainter.

## Push Sequence
1. `cf push`
2. rest request to cloud controller to `create app`
3. Cloud Controller DB `stores app metadata`  
4. rest request to cloud controller to `upload files`
5. cloud controller persist app files into the *Blob Store*
6. rest request to cloud controller to `start app`
7. stage app into a cell
8. tream staging output back to cli
9. store droplet on the blob store
10. report staging complete
11. start staged app
12. report app status

## buildpack
- buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for your applications
- in other words, they build immutable droplets (stage your application)

## High Availability
- application instances are evenly distributed across availability zones
- application stays up dispite loosing an AZ
*Bosh Managed Processes*
- elastic runtime processes are monitored and automatically restarted.
	- cloud controller vm: cloud controller process, monit, bosh agent
		- cloud controller process has failed. monit responsible for restarting it
		- restart event is reported back to the Health Monitor for further investigation
			- monit restart pass event to bosh agent, which pass it to BOSH
			- BOSH/Ops Manage Directory
				- vm that responsible for managing the entire distributed system
				- boss agent send data through message bus to Health Monitor
					- plugins: pager, email, resurrector
*Failed VMs*
- bosh agent continuuously reports health of the VM/job
	- through message bus to Health Monitor
	- if vm goes down, Health Monitor get BOSH directory to recreate/provision new VM/job

*Self Healing Application Instances*
- once running, failed application instances will be rectead

`cf scale <app> -m 1G`
`cf scale <app> -i 3`

`cf logs <app> | grep "API\|CELL"`
`cf events <app>`


During the course there are a few examples of scenarios when restaging is required. Examples:
	- When you bind an app to NewRelic, the app needs to be rebuild to include the agent in the dropplet.
	- When a buildpack is customized using environment variables to specify a concrete version of Java or Tomcat, the dropplet needs to be rebuild.

From the examples we can say that the restaging is needed when a change is the dropplet is needed, it can be because the app needs to be rebuild to include new libraries or because the runtime changes.
